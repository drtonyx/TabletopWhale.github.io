				<title>Planet Earth Control Deck</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s January already, which means it&amp;#39;s tax season! I dislike filing taxes as much as the next person, but I figured I might as well make the most of it this year. So I made an infographic celebrating one of my favorite tax-funded programs in America - NASA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wanted to show what Earth&amp;#39;s control panel might look like if it was a spaceship piloted by humans. It&amp;#39;s a bit too busy with all the flashing lights, but I was going for a mix between Star Trek and pinball so I&amp;#39;m still pretty happy with how it turned out. All of the data should be scientifically accurate, even if it&amp;#39;s moving too fast to read properly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a side note, this might be the only infographic I post for a while. I&amp;#39;m working on a pretty extensive non-science art project right now, and it&amp;#39;s been taking up a lot of my time. I was also invited to be on the panel of judges for the Malofiej Infographics Summit in Spain, so I&amp;#39;m going to be out of town for a while doing conference things.  But I promise I haven&amp;#39;t forgotten about this blog, and I&amp;#39;ll be back soon with more science :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;small&gt; Edit: A couple people said that an interactive version would be awesome. I don&amp;#39;t really feel like remaking this, but if any of you want to build a web app or Rainmeter theme or whatever, you&amp;#39;re welcome to use my design. I can send you the star map file if you email me. Everything else is easily derived from equations or NASA/local weather data. Oh, and I don&amp;#39;t care if you make money from your remake, but please credit me somewhere in the design and in the comment code. &lt;/small&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;sources&quot;&gt;

				<title>How to build a human</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s been a while since I made a science infographic! But hopefully this month&amp;#39;s post is full of enough biology to make up for the wait. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve actually wanted to do an embryogenesis GIF for months, but I couldn&amp;#39;t quite figure out how to make it work. Then I stumbled across &lt;a href=&quot;http://imgur.com/0MNXclx&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;this awesome GIF &lt;/a&gt; on Reddit and got the idea to use a spiraling animation style. (Incidentally, if anyone knows who made that GIF I&amp;#39;d love to know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m actually really happy with how this turned out. I made this using 44 animations that are 9 frames each. That&amp;#39;s 396 sketches total - probably the most complicated GIF I&amp;#39;ve made so far. I am a little sad that I wasn&amp;#39;t able to show size properly though. For example. the 24 week fetus is about 40 times heavier than a 12 week fetus (but you can&amp;#39;t tell that from this drawing). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is my last post for 2014, so happy holidays everyone! Thanks so much for reading Tabletop Whale and supporting my art :) &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What you need to build your own computer</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve been really busy this month working with some awesome science writers! Because of that I haven&amp;#39;t had much time for GIFs, but I did manage to fit in a non-moving infographic for this month&amp;#39;s post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This month I also replaced my 5-year old Mac with a custom PC, so I decided to make something with a computer theme. There&amp;#39;s already tons of tutorials on the internet about building computers, so this poster&amp;#39;s more of an illustrated list than an actual set of instructions. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was really fun putting the computer together, and my new PC is awesome. I have dual monitors now, and I can finally run all of my design programs at the same time at max speed :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it was harder than I thought to set up a computer - kind of like Ikea furniture on extra hard mode. My boyfriend helped me out a lot, but it still took 5 hours because we forgot the motherboard spacers the first time around. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, thanks for putting up with the slow updates to this blog. This month has been really hectic and I&amp;#39;m looking forward to having the time to animate again. I do have something already in the works, so stay tuned for a science packed GIF for my next post. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Tabletop Whale&#39;s guide to making GIFs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of emails asking for a tutorial on how to make animations. So this week I put together a quick explanation for anyone who&amp;#39;s interested. I archived it as a link on the menu bar of my website, so it&amp;#39;ll always be easy to find if you need it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a run-through of my own personal animation workflow, so it&amp;#39;s not a definitive guide or anything. There are plenty of other ways to make animations in Photoshop and other programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never tried making a tutorial about my own work before, so sorry in advance if it&amp;#39;s confusing! Let me know if there&amp;#39;s anything I wrote that didn&amp;#39;t make any sense. I&amp;#39;ll try to fix it if I can (though I probably don&amp;#39;t have room to go into detail about every single Photoshop function I mention).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An animated guide to breathing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As promised, this month&amp;#39;s infographic is packed with actual science. I decided to illustrate how different animals breathe, and I picked three species that I thought were particularly awesome. The topic really lends itself to a short looped GIF so that was an added plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#39;m getting my new computer this week! It&amp;#39;s going to be awesome working on something that can have more than one heavy-duty application running at once. And to make things even better, it&amp;#39;s almost Halloween. Have an awesome weekend guys :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Flight videos deconstructed</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s post isn&amp;#39;t entirely scientific, but I thought I&amp;#39;d upload it anyway since it&amp;#39;s related to animals and patterns in nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked in an insect lab as an undergrad, I helped out with an experiment about mosquito larvae. As part of the process we used a Matlab program to manually input the larva&amp;#39;s location during thousands of video frames. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun experiment, and I wanted to make something similar from Youtube videos. I found slow-motion videos of five flying species, and mapped out specific points on the wings during one wingbeat. I ended up with 15 frames per wingbeat, and I connected every frame using imaginary curves that went through all of the 15 mapped points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, 15 frames isn&amp;#39;t nearly enough for any kind of factual conclusion, so this week&amp;#39;s post is just an art exercise. But hopefully you can enjoy this as an artistic pattern based on real life :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. My next post will be more grounded in fact, so don&amp;#39;t worry if you weren&amp;#39;t that into this art post.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An animated chart of 42 North American butterflies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;#39;s infographic was pretty science intensive, so this one is a bit more frivolous for a change. I checked out six butterfly field guides from the library and picked out some of the species I thought were the most unique and beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s meant as a chart of decorative species illustrations rather than an educational infographic. So it doesn&amp;#39;t have as much information as my other posts, but I did draw everything as true to life as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An animated guide to the human body &amp;#58; The muscle edition</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I love GIFs as an art form, so this month I tried making an infographic GIF. It&amp;#39;s a 25-frame stop motion animation made mostly in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never made an animation this complex before, and I had a ton of fun with it. I&amp;#39;m definitely planning on more animated infographics in the future. I might even learn After Effects, though I&amp;#39;ll have to see how feasible that is since my computer&amp;#39;s getting kind of old and slow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, critiques and comments are very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A visual compendium of glowing creatures</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys! My name is Eleanor and I&amp;#39;m a self-employed artist from Seattle. This blog post is the first installment of what will hopefully be a year-long infographic design project. I&amp;#39;ve always been into biology and design, so I&amp;#39;m taking a year off after college to see if I can combine the two with at least marginal success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more of an experiment than anything else, so feel free to leave comments about what works, what doesn&amp;#39;t, and what might be scientifically incorrect despite my best efforts. I spend a lot of time trying to make these infographics accurate (for this post I read a 468 page textbook and used over 200 other sources) but naturally I&amp;#39;m not an expert in every subject I write about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s post diagrams a few of the most well studied bioluminescent organisms. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for stopping by :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;invisible-for-rss-only&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/07-21-14.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;
