				<title>An animated guide to the human body &amp;#58; The muscle edition</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I love GIFs as an art form, so this month I tried making an infographic GIF. It&amp;#39;s a 25-frame stop motion animation made mostly in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never made an animation this complex before, and I had a ton of fun with it. I&amp;#39;m definitely planning on more animated infographics in the future. I might even learn After Effects, though I&amp;#39;ll have to see how feasable that is since my computer&amp;#39;s getting kind of old and slow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, critiques and comments are very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A visual compendium of glowing creatures</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys! My name is Eleanor and I&amp;#39;m a self-employed artist from Seattle. This blog post is the first installment of what will hopefully be a year-long infographic design project. I&amp;#39;ve always been into biology and design, so I&amp;#39;m taking a year off after college to see if I can combine the two with at least marginal success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more of an experiment than anything else, so feel free to leave comments about what works, what doesn&amp;#39;t, and what might be scientifically incorrect despite my best efforts. I spend a lot of time trying to make these infographics accurate (for this post I read a 468 page textbook and used over 200 other sources) but naturally I&amp;#39;m not an expert in every subject I write about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s post diagrams a few of the most well studied bioluminescent organisms. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for stopping by :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Thank you to bioluminescence researcher &lt;a href=&quot;http://biolum.eemb.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Steven Haddock&lt;/a&gt; for his help with animal physiology, and to evolutionary biologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/view/paps%20montserrat_j.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jordi Paps&lt;/a&gt; for his help with phylogeny. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The majority of the information used in this chart comes from the textbook &lt;i&gt;Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods (Revised Edition)&lt;/i&gt; by Osamu Shimomura.&lt;/li&gt;
