				<title>A visual compendium of glowing creatures</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys! My name is Eleanor and I&amp;#39;m a self-employed artist from Seattle. This blog post is the first installment of what will hopefully be a year-long infographic design project. I&amp;#39;ve always been into biology and design, so I&amp;#39;m taking a year off after college to see if I can combine the two with at least marginal success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more of an experiment than anything else, so feel free to leave comments about what works, what doesn&amp;#39;t, and what might be scientifically incorrect despite my best efforts. I spend a lot of time trying to make these infographics accurate (for this post I read a 468 page textbook and used over 200 other sources) but naturally I&amp;#39;m not an expert in every subject I write about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s post diagrams a few of the most well studied bioluminescent organisms. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for stopping by :)&lt;/p&gt;
