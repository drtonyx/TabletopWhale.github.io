				<title>Tabletop Whale&#39;s quick guide to making GIFs</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;#39;ve been getting a lot of emails asking for a tutorial on how to make animations. I don&amp;#39;t think I use any particularly unique techniques, but I put together a quick explanation for anyone who&amp;#39;s interested. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just a run-through of my own personal animation workflow, so it&amp;#39;s not a definitive guide or anything. There are plenty of other ways to make animations in Photoshop and other programs. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never tried making a tutorial about my own work before, so sorry in advance if it&amp;#39;s confusing! Let me know if there&amp;#39;s anything I wrote that didn&amp;#39;t make any sense. I&amp;#39;ll try to fix it if I can (though I probably don&amp;#39;t have room to go into detail about every single Photoshop function I mention).&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An animated guide to breathing</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As promised, this month&amp;#39;s infographic is packed with actual science. I decided to illustrate how different animals breathe, and I picked three species that I thought were particularly awesome. The topic really lends itself to a short looped GIF so that was an added plus. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other news, I&amp;#39;m getting my new computer this week! It&amp;#39;s going to be awesome working on something that can have more than one heavy-duty application running at once. And to make things even better, it&amp;#39;s almost Halloween. Have an awesome weekend guys :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Flight videos deconstructed</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;This week&amp;#39;s post isn&amp;#39;t entirely scientific, but I thought I&amp;#39;d upload it anyway since it&amp;#39;s related to animals and patterns in nature. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I worked in an insect lab as an undergrad, I helped out with an experiment about mosquito larvae. As part of the process we used a Matlab program to manually input the larva&amp;#39;s location during thousands of video frames. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a fun experiment, and I wanted to make something similar from Youtube videos. I found slow-motion videos of five flying species, and mapped out specific points on the wings during one wingbeat. I ended up with 15 frames per wingbeat, and I connected every frame using imaginary curves that went through all of the 15 mapped points. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course, 15 frames isn&amp;#39;t nearly enough for any kind of factual conclusion, so this week&amp;#39;s post is just an art exercise. But hopefully you can enjoy this as an artistic pattern based on real life :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;P.S. My next post will be more grounded in fact, so don&amp;#39;t worry if you weren&amp;#39;t that into this art post.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An animated chart of 42 North American butterflies</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Last week&amp;#39;s infographic was pretty science intensive, so this one is a bit more frivolous for a change. I checked out six butterfly field guides from the library and picked out some of the species I thought were the most unique and beautiful. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s meant as a chart of decorative species illustrations rather than an educational infographic. So it doesn&amp;#39;t have as much information as my other posts, but I did draw everything as true to life as I could.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>An animated guide to the human body &amp;#58; The muscle edition</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I love GIFs as an art form, so this month I tried making an infographic GIF. It&amp;#39;s a 25-frame stop motion animation made mostly in Photoshop.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve never made an animation this complex before, and I had a ton of fun with it. I&amp;#39;m definitely planning on more animated infographics in the future. I might even learn After Effects, though I&amp;#39;ll have to see how feasible that is since my computer&amp;#39;s getting kind of old and slow. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always, critiques and comments are very welcome :)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A visual compendium of glowing creatures</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hi guys! My name is Eleanor and I&amp;#39;m a self-employed artist from Seattle. This blog post is the first installment of what will hopefully be a year-long infographic design project. I&amp;#39;ve always been into biology and design, so I&amp;#39;m taking a year off after college to see if I can combine the two with at least marginal success.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s more of an experiment than anything else, so feel free to leave comments about what works, what doesn&amp;#39;t, and what might be scientifically incorrect despite my best efforts. I spend a lot of time trying to make these infographics accurate (for this post I read a 468 page textbook and used over 200 other sources) but naturally I&amp;#39;m not an expert in every subject I write about. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today&amp;#39;s post diagrams a few of the most well studied bioluminescent organisms. Hope you enjoy it, and thanks for stopping by :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div&gt; &lt;img class=&quot;invisible-for-rss-only&quot; src=&quot;/img/posts/07-21-14.png&quot; /&gt; &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;ul class=&quot;sources&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Acknowledgements&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; Thank you to bioluminescence researcher &lt;a href=&quot;http://biolum.eemb.ucsb.edu/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Steven Haddock&lt;/a&gt; for his help with animal physiology, and to evolutionary biologist &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.zoo.ox.ac.uk/people/view/paps%20montserrat_j.htm&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Jordi Paps&lt;/a&gt; for his help with phylogeny. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt; The majority of the information used in this chart comes from the textbook &lt;i&gt;Bioluminescence: Chemical Principles and Methods (Revised Edition)&lt;/i&gt; by Osamu Shimomura.&lt;/li&gt;
