description: Introducing the first set of DotA2 playing cards!
---

This post is neither science-related nor animated, but I wanted to share a side project that I've been working on for the past couple of months! I play a lot of DotA2 with friends, so for fun I decided to make a deck of cards featuring some of the characters from the game. The full game has something like 110 characters, so I just picked the most popular ones for the project. 

Making the deck took way longer than I anticipated, but I'm much faster at digital painting now. And it was a nice change of pace to have a long-term hobby project instead of sketching individual little drawings in my free time. The cards are on the <a href="http://steamcommunity.com//sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=403742997" target="blank">Dota2 Workshop</a>, so if you have a Steam account feel free to leave a comment or vote on the submission!

I'm considering making a science deck of cards as my next side project, where each card illustrates a different branch of science. I'll have to make sure I can think of 52 different science subjects though. The obvious ones (physics, astronomy) will definitely be included, but let me know in the comments if there's a somewhat obscure type of science that you think would be a good fit :)
