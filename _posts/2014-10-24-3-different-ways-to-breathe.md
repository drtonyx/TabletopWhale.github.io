description: An animated infographic showing how three different animals breathe in and out.  
---

As promised, this month's infographic is packed with actual science. I decided to illustrate how different animals breathe, and I picked three species that I thought were particularly awesome. The topic really lends itself to a short looped GIF so that was an added plus. 

In other news, I'm getting my new computer this week! It's going to be awesome working on something that can have more than one heavy-duty application running at once. And to make things even better, it's almost Halloween. Have an awesome weekend guys :)
