description: The next best thing to butterfly watching in the American wild.

Last week's infographic was pretty science intensive, so this one is a bit more frivolous for a change. I checked out six butterfly field guides from the library and picked out some of the species I thought were the most unique and beautiful. 

It's meant as a chart of decorative species illustrations rather than an educational infographic. So it doesn't have as much information as my other posts, but I did draw everything as true to life as I could.
