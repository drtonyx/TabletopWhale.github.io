Recently I've been getting a lot of emails asking for a tutorial on how to make animations. I don't think I use any particularly unique techniques, but I put together a quick explanation for anyone who's interested. 

This is just a run-through of my own personal animation workflow, so it's not a definitive guide or anything. There are plenty of other ways to make animations in Photoshop and other programs. 

I've never tried making a tutorial about my own work before, so sorry in advance if it's confusing! Let me know if there's anything I wrote that didn't make any sense. I'll try to fix it if I can (though I probably don't have room to go into detail about every single Photoshop function I mention).
